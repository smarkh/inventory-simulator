Samples latest buying patterns to determine at risk product

This program uses the last six weeks of sales data to estimate the following weeks inventory levels and needs. 

This is done by taking 20 samples of the last six weeks of data to create an estimate of what will be sold next week. Then it compares those numbers to current inventory
levels and assigns a priority number to what should be replenished. 

Finally it outputs an excel sheet that has the analysed inventory numbers, so the information is easily distributed to those who need it.
